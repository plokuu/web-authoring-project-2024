    <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
    <p>
        My name's Johnathan O'Reilly and I've been a vintage car collector for the better part of 35 years now. 
       <br> My love for cars flourished from my early years. My father, Joesoph O'Reilly, was a prolific formula one racer in the 50s to 60s.
       <br> Dad always let me help him work on his cars and I gained great appreciation in his craft.
       <br> Tragically, his life was cut short in a terrible collision in the Grand Prix.
       <br> When I was 30, I opened my very own auto-repair shop down at Sandymount and I took on repairing and rejuvenating vintage vehicles from his time.
       <br> Since, We've franchised the business to become a nationwide sucesss.

    <h2><em>Car Showcasing events</em></h2>
    <p>
        Every Sunday moring at 10 to 12, We host a car showcasing at Marlay Park. 
        <br> Down below is a beatiful photo of one of our showcasing events we held this summer.  
       <br> Its open to the public so don't be shy to pop down.
       <br> We welcome families and even have an ice-cream truck brought down for the kids!
       <br> Anyone who wants to bring their own car(s) can submit an application with a picture tagged with it.
       <br> We'd love to meet more likeminded indivials and broaden our community!
